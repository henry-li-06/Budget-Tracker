This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run the budget tracker frontend, first install dependencies with: 

### `npm install`

After installing dependencies, run the front end with: 

### `npm start`

You can now access the app with 
http://127.0.0.1:3000/ or http://localhost:3000

To connect with the flask API and the database, you must open the app in
http://127.0.0.1:3000/, or the equivalent link given by your terminal.
